      This report describes the results of a taxonomic identification analysis for the sample
      <code>{{ metadata.sample_id }}</code>.
      The analysis compares the sample's DNA sequence against a reference database of sequences with known taxonomy.
      The results include the best matches from the database, which are referred to as "Candidates". To provide rigour, the report also includes an analysis of supporting publications (a measure of the integrity of candidate hit sequences), and database coverage of the different taxa that are of interest to the report.
