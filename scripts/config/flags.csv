6,Phylogenetic assessment,A,Candidate species grouped within single clade,The query sequence is genetically consistent with sequences of the best-matching species,1
6,Phylogenetic assessment,B,The query sequence clusters as sister to a species-specific clade or as a single branch in a tree,"The sample is genetically distinct from the sequences of the best-matching species, and may lack representation in the reference database. This indicates that the sample organism is either poorly studied or a potential novel species.",2
