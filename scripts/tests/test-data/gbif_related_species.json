Notes. Cheiloxena westwoodii is the most widespread and frequently collected species of the genus and also the most variable. Reid (1992) suggested that there were two geographically defined forms, separated by a gap of about 200 km in central eastern NSW. That gap is here reduced to about 125 km but is still evident (Fig. 78). The northern form is generally more strongly sculptured on the elytra, with larger and more numerous tubercles or ridges. This form exists as far south as Robertson (34.59 \u00b0 S), from where there is a single specimen with numerous prominent elytral tubercles. Southern specimens, from Mount Bibbenluke (35.26 \u00b0 S) southwards, are generally smoother, without conspicuous tubercles, but a few specimens in the south are as tuberculate as the least tuberculate northern specimens. Another character that separates the records geographically is the density of setae on the ventral surfaces of the femora. Specimens from Barrington Tops (32.03 \u00b0 S) northwards have the femoral ventral surfaces densely covered in pale grey scales, whereas specimens from Culoul Range (33.23 \u00b0 S) southwards have increasingly sparser setae, with the femoral ventral surface visible. Other variable features include shape of elytral apices, shape of male maxillary palpi and convexity of female eyes, but these features do not vary geographically. There are no consistent genitalic differences between these populations or forms therefore we prefer to treat all as a single variable species. The distribution of Cheiloxena westwoodii almost overlaps with all other species, from southern Victoria to southeastern Queensland (Fig. 78). Within this range it is associated with eucalypt woodland and forest. Several adults of C. westwoodii were collected on Astrotricha latifolia (Araliaceae) at Kuringai Chase National Park and caged for two weeks with this plant, but failed to reproduce, although they fed on the foliage. A specimen was also collected on Astrotricha ledifolia in the Brindabella Ranges, ACT. The host plants are probably various species of Astrotricha, but it has also been collected from eucalypts and from a \" fern-like shrub somewhat similar to Lomatia \". The species has been photographed at several sites in Victoria, including Cambarville (Monaghan 2018), Dandenong Ranges (Monaghan 2018), Garfield (Lagerway 2016 a), Powelltown (Monaghan 2018) and Reefton (Monaghan 2018). Adults are occasionally attracted to ultraviolet light."

Notes. Cheiloxena blackburni is only known from the Blue Mountains, NSW (Fig. 77, including aditional localities from Reid 1992), Kosciuszko National Park region (a specimen labelled ' Kosc. '), at least 250 km further south, and a single specimen from Balook, Victoria, in MVM (Reid 1992). We think the Balook specimen was mislabelled by Charles Oke, former curator of the MVM entomology collection. Balook is a lowland site with quite different vegetation from Blackheath in the Blue Mountains, which is the only other definitive locality for this species. There is a similar label problem for a specimen of C. insignis (see below). The ' Kosc' female is lacking its abdomen and is without detailed locality information. All of the known specimens of Cheiloxena blackburni are old, mostly from the collections of E. W. Ferguson (1884 \u2013 1927), H. W. Brown (1883 \u2013 1958) and H. J. Carter (1858 \u2013 1940) (Daniels 2004). Only one is dated, anonymously collected in January 1935 (the ' Kosc' specimen). In the unlikely event Brown collected his specimens in the last year of his life, the most recent collection date for this large beetle species is 1958, at least 60 years ago."

Cheiloxena monga is only known from the holotype, collected at the margin of cool temperate rainforest and tall eucalypt forest in what is now Monga National Park. It was beaten off a sapling of Eucalyptus rubida, now a synonym of E. dalrympleana (Myrtaceae), with no evidence of feeding. This specimen was previously incorporated in a description of C. frenchae, when the only other known specimen of that species was the holotype (Reid 1992). Based on the small amount of additional material of this complex (C. aitori, C. frenchae and C. monga) made available since 1992 we now believe that the Monga specimen represents a valid species."

Cheiloxena aitori is endemic to the New England National Park area (Fig. 77), occuring in the cool temperate rainforest and wet heathland near the escarpment edge, at approximately 1500 m elevation. The placename Ebor on an old specimen probably refers to this town because it is the nearest settlement to the escarpment. Ebor is unlikely to be a collection locality as it is surrounded by quite different habitat (dry woodland). Faecal material in the gut of a dissected male largely consisted of densely packed fragmented trichomes. A specimen of this species was photographed on a leaf of Lomatia arborescens (Proteaceae) (identified by one of the authors, C. Reid) at the type locality, by Adam \u015alipi\u0144ski (pers. comm., February 2018). Cheiloxena aitori has been collected at light."

Length: male 13 \u2013 15.5 mm (Holotype: 13 mm), female 14 \u2013 15.5 mm; body moderately convex in profile, length about 3 x height; colour dull black, tarsi and antennae usually dark brown, maxillary palpi dark reddish-brown; entirely clothed with adpressed scale-like setae (length 3 \u2013 4 x width), setae patchily distributed on elytra, thinner and sparser on appendages and apical ventrites; surface sculpture: head, pronotum and elytra dull, punctate and densely microsculptured, except shining apices of tubercles and ridges. Head (Figs 5, 15, 24): distinctly narrower than pronotum in both sexes, width 0.8 x (male) or 0.7 x (female) pronotal width; middle of vertex slightly elevated; densely punctured (separated by <1 diameter) except sparser on middle of vertex in two specimens (separated by 1 \u2013 2 diameters); narrow impunctate smooth area around antennal cavities; slightly convex between eyes, but flat between antennae, without groove on vertex but midline smooth in two specimens; eyes small, elongate-reniform, strongly laterally prominent, separated by about 4 eye widths in both sexes; gena at shortest point about half eye length in both sexes; genal lobe about 1.5 x shortest length gena; antennae 6 \u2013 7 socket diameters apart; antennae about 0.7 x body length (male), or about 0.6 x body length (female); all antennomeres dull, 1 \u2013 7 sparsely and coarsely setose, 8 \u2013 11 densely and finely setose; antennomeres 1 and 3 \u2013 11 elongate, 2 quadrate 0.5 x length 1, <0.3 x length 3, relative lengths of antennomeres with 3 longest and 11 next, in both sexes, and most middle segments of similar length: 2 shortest, <1, <6, <4 = 5 = 7, <8, <9 = 10, <11, <3; clypeus without long subapical setae; clypeal anterior margin semicircularly excavate; male apical maxillary palpomere elongate-ovate with truncate apex. Thorax (Figs 5, 15, 24, 33): pronotal sides almost vertical in posterior half, no clear distinction between dorsal and ventral (hypomeral) areas of pronotum, but with roughly equilateral triangular extension just anterior to middle and 1 \u2013 2 low tubercles on a ridge from this extension to anterior angles; pronotal disc irregularly surfaced, with pair of low shining tubercles anteriorly reaching anterior pronotal margin, midline depressed for anterior 2 / 3 but with low swelling posteriorly, sides deeply depressed; pronotal punctures large, close to dense, separated by 0.2 \u2013 1.5 puncture diameters; pronotum with fairly evenly distributed scale-like setae, as head, interspaces dull and densely microreticulate; pronotum clearly transverse, width 1.3 x length (male) to 1.4 x (female), greatest width at lateral triangular lobe, sides concave behind this; anterior angles prominently anteriorly produced, 80 \u00b0; anterior edge produced but concave at middle, basal edge weakly convex; hypomeron and prosternum densely punctured and pubescent as pronotum, except hypomeral lobe rugose and glabrous; scutellum punctured and apically shining, but more densely scaled than pronotum; elytra with scales irregularly distributed, forming a patchwork of glabrous and scaled areas, the latter sometimes denser forming pale spots; elytron tuberculate, but shiny tipped tubercles small not distinctly elevated, irregularly arranged in approximately 4 longitudinal rows, as follows: first (innermost) with 7 \u2013 10 small tubercles; second with 5 \u2013 8 small tubercles, usually with largest level with apex hind femur; third starting on inner surface of humerus, with 5 \u2013 10 small tubercles; fourth starting on outer surface of humerus, with 5 \u2013 8 small tubercles; elytral disc not or feebly transversely depressed in basal half, posterior to humerus; elytral punctures large (same as pronotal punctures) and deep, sparsely but evenly distributed, separated by 1.5 \u2013 2 x diameters, interspaces dull, microsculptured; each elytral puncture with one small dull tubercle on anterior surface and small seta inside; elytral apex rounded; epipleuron finely and shallowly punctured with scale-like pubescence; mesoventrite punctured as prosternum; metepisternum and metaventrite dull, densely punctured and scaled, except shining and sparsely punctured midline; metatibiae with shallow irregular lateral longitudinal grooves, short and robust; bases of tarsomeres 1 \u2013 3 not depressed; protarsomeres 1 \u2013 3 equally narrow at base in both sexes. Abdomen (Figs 45, 54, 64, 71): ventrites I \u2013 V entirely dull, microreticulate; I more closely and strongly punctured at middle (interspaces less than or equal to puncture diameters), sparsely punctured at sides (interspaces much greater than puncture diameters); puncturation of II \u2013 IV similar to I; ventrite V densely and rugosely punctured; ventrite pubescence recumbent and scale-like, fine erect setae only present on apical margin of ventrite V; apex of ventrite V truncate in male, with thickened edge, convex in female; apex of penis contracted to mucronate tip in dorsal view, apex thick and short in lateral view; tegminal keel shallowly convex in lateral view; female sternite VIII apodeme short and narrow, apical sclerotised area triangular, about as long as wide, apex truncate; setae at apex of gonocoxite short and inconspicuous; stylus elongate, length twice width; median ventral sclerite elongate-triangular, distinctly sclerotised; spermatheca falcate, acutely tipped, with simple uncoiled duct."

          "description": "Etymology. Named for Conan, eldest son of M. Beatson. Notes. Cheiloxena conani has been collected from two upland localities in central and south Queensland, Kroombit Tops and Wonga Hills (Fig. 77). Kroombit Tops, an isolated low massif (930 m elevation), is unusual for its relatively temperate flora and fauna at 24 \u00b0 S (Monteith 1986). The old specimens labelled \u2018 Rockhampton\u2019 by Brown may have been collected at Kroombit Tops (115 km south of Rockhampton) or possibly in the lower elevation hills 50 km south of Rockhampton (maximum elevation 746 m) (G. Monteith, pers. com. 2013). The other locality, Wonga Hills, is a plateau at about 300 m elevation with low hills up to 550 m elevation, with large blocks of vine-thicket rainforest and eucalypt forest. The Wonga Hills site is 185 km south of Kroombit Tops. The two most recently collected specimens were at light, in vine thicket and open forest, in December and February."
