  This page lists permitted values for the <code>locus</code> field in the <code>metadata.csv</code> input file. Many of these loci are synonyms for the same target - it does not matter which synonym is specified as the input.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">
  For virus queries and workflow runs using the BOLD database, the locus field is not required. In these cases, you should set this field to <code>NA</code>.
</p>

<p class="alert alert-info">
  These values describe the default <code>loci.json</code> file that is defined in the workflow. It is possible for administrators to replace this with a custom file. If this might the case, please request a list of allowed loci from your service administrator.

  {% for locus in loci %}
